# Sample Website

I think that the tutorial would like me to just copy and paste the text from it, however I don't want to do that because you never know what they are hiding in there.

This is a sample website form the [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial). It's pretty good.

Go check it out.
